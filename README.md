The code and dataset for our study on eye-gaze-based text prediction leverage multiple computer vision models, such as YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, DeepLab, U-Net, and SimCLR. The project aims to enhance accuracy and speed by integrating text suggestions with eye-gaze tracking.
ðŸ§  Project Overview
Purpose: Develop a system to predict text based on eye-gaze movements, enhancing communication for users with limited physical abilities.

Models Used: YOLOv8, SSD, Faster R-CNN, DeepLabv3, and U-Net, YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, DeepLab, U-Net, and SimCLR


Key Contributions:

  1. Implemented multiple models to improve accuracy and processing speed.
  2. Combined eye-gaze tracking with text prediction.
  3. Evaluated the impact of text suggestions on typing speed.

Requirements
  1. Python 3.x
  2. TensorFlow / PyTorch
  3. OpenCV
  4. dlib

     
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Each folder contains two subfolders: The first folder under the model name is the folder of training, 
The second folder is called writing, in which the eye-gaze is implemented using the model.
